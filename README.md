## 🚀 What It Does

Paste in an Upwork job description.  
The app takes that input and feeds it into a carefully crafted ChatGPT prompt using GPT-4o-mini, returning a proposal tailored to that specific gig.

Whether you're applying for data roles, prompt engineering gigs, or AI-related jobs — this tool gets you started faster with more targeted, relevant language.

## 🎯 Why I Made It

As a freelance Data & Prompt Engineer, I wanted to see how far I could push LLMs to **compete with real Upwork providers** — and maybe outperform them.  
This is part automation, part experiment, part hustle. 🛠️⚡
