Hi there,

I’m Nicholas Joseph, a seasoned Product Manager with over 7 years of experience in Agile environments, and I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to your fast-growing B2B SaaS startup. My background in managing cross-functional teams and my expertise in client engagement uniquely qualify me to lead your weekly customer calls and ensure all deliverables are on track.

At Spaulding Ridge, I successfully led the migration of complex data systems for high-profile clients, enhancing data efficiency by 98.9%. I excel in prioritizing customer requirements for development teams, running bi-weekly sprints, and facilitating daily stand-ups to keep projects moving forward. My experience interfacing with C-suite executives and presenting product performance insights has honed my ability to align customer needs with development goals effectively.

Additionally, my foundational work in my own business, NobleHands, allowed me to nurture client relationships and resolve conflicts through active listening and strategic communication, driving a 200% growth rate in a single year.

I am eager to discuss how my skills can contribute to your team’s success. Let’s connect to explore this opportunity further!

Best,  
Nicholas Joseph
